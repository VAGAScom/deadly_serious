# DeadlySerious

Flow Based Programming Engine mechanically sympathetic to \*nix.

Flow Based Programming engine that relies on named pipes and Linux processes (sorry, it not works on Windows right now). That means it uses "mechanical sympathy" with the Operating System, i.e., the S.O. is *part* of the program, it's not something *below* it.

**REQUIRES** Ruby 2.0 and a \*nix based SO (tested on *Ubuntu* and *Arch Linux*)
